# Orders Command-Line Interface Specification

This document lays out the command-line interface to interact with the Planet
[Orders API](https://developers.planet.com/docs/orders/).

## list

### Interface

Usage: planet orders list [OPTIONS]

  List orders

  This command outputs a sequence of the returned order descriptions. If --pretty is specified, each order description is pretty-printed.

Options:
  --state CHOICE   Filter orders to given state.
  --limit INTEGER  Maximum number of results to return. Default is 100. A
                   value of 0 means no maximum.
  --pretty         Format JSON output.
  --help           Show this message and exit.


### Usage Examples

User Story: As a CLI user I would like to get a json blob that describes up to the last 100 of my orders so that I can use jq to get their dates.

```
$ planet orders list
```
```
{"_links": …}
{"_links": …}
{"_links": …}
…
```

User Story: As a CLI user I would like to get a json blob that describes all of my orders so that I can use jq to get their dates.
```
$ planet orders list --limit 0
```
```
{"_links": …}
{"_links": …}
{"_links": …}
…
```

User Story: As a CLI user I would like to get a json blob that describes my last 5 successful orders so that I can use jq to get their order dates.
```
$ planet orders list --state success --limit 1
```
response (pretty-printed)
```

Basic usage:

```
$ planet orders download 49b8d32e-2fba-4924-bd38-f7344aa48d91
<ANSI download status reporting>
```

User Story: As a CLI user I would like to download an order without ANSI reporting

```
$ planet –quiet orders download 49b8d32e-2fba-4924-bd38-f7344aa48d91
```

--overwrite \
49b8d32e-2fba-4924-bd38-f7344aa48d91
<ANSI download status reporting>
```

User Story: As a CLI user I would like to download an order and check the md5
checksums against the manifest to ensure that no files are corrupt.

```
$ planet orders download \
--checksum md5 \
49b8d32e-2fba-4924-bd38-f7344aa48d91
<ANSI download status reporting>
<Error if check fails>
```

## create


### Interface

Usage: planet orders create [REQUEST]

  Create an order.

This command creates an order from an order request. It outputs the created order description, optionally pretty-printed.

REQUEST is the full description of the order to be created. It must be JSON
and can be specified a json string, filename, or '-' for stdin.
It defaults to reading from stdin.

Options:
  -pp, --pretty     Format JSON output.

### Usage Examples

User Story: As a CLI user I would like to create an order from a file.

```
$ planet orders create order_request.json
{"_links": …}
```

User Story: As a CLI user I would like to create an order from stdin.

```
$ cat order_request.json | planet orders create
{"_links": …}
```

User Story: As a CLI user I would like to duplicate an order.

```
$ planet orders get 65df4eb0-e416-4243-a4d2-38afcf382c30 | planet orders create
{"_links": …}
```

## request

It is a common use case to want to create an order that is just slightly
different from another order. Maybe the order has the same toolchain but just
new ids. Maybe the order has the same ids but just a different clip AOI. It
would be nice to just update the old order request with the new information
instead of having to start from scratch.


### Interface

Usage: planet orders request [OPTIONS]

Generate an order request.

This command provides support for building an order description used in creating an order. It outputs the order request, optionally pretty-
printed.

  Support for building and editing an order description is provided however it
  has many limitations compared to what the Orders API supports. For creation
  of more advanced order requests, create the order description manually or
  use the Python library to aid in creating the order description.

  There are two ways to build an order description: 1. starting from scratch
  and providing all necessary order parameters and 2. starting from a pre-
  existing order description and optionally overriding some parameters.

  1. Starting from scratch:

  When creating an order description from scratch, the following options are
  required: --name, --bundle, and one (and only one) of --id or --search-id.

  To create an order clipped to an Area of Interest (AOI), use the --clip
  option. This option supports a file and stdin.

  To create a clipped order request using a file:

  $ planet orders request \
      --name test_order \
      --bundle analytic \
      --id 20200922_183724_23_106a,20200922_183722_17_106a \
      --clip aoi.geojson

  To create a clipped order using stdin:

  $ planet orders request \
      --name test_order \
      --bundle analytic \
      --id 20200922_183724_23_106a,20200922_183722_17_106a \
      --clip - < aoi.geojson

  Accomplishing the same thing but with a search id instead of item ids:

  $ planet orders request \
      --name test_order \
      --bundle analytic \
      --search-id 897802165e8d4bd587e342a4b399eda6 \
      --clip - < aoi.geojson

  2. Starting from an order description:

  To create an order from an order description, use the --like option. This
  option supports a file, stdin, and order id. Stdin can be used as input to
  only one of the --like and --clip options.

  If --like option is provided, all other options are not required. If they
  are provided, they will override the corresponding entry in the order
  description passed to --like.

  To create an order using an order id and override the item IDs:

  $ planet orders get 49b8d32e-2fba-4924-bd38-f7344aa48d91 > \
planet orders request --like - \
--id 20200922_183724_23_106a,20200922_183722_17_106a

  To the item ids can also be read from a saved search:

  $ planet orders get 49b8d32e-2fba-4924-bd38-f7344aa48d91 > \
planet orders request --search-id 897802165e8d4bd587e342a4b399eda6

  To create an order using an order id and clip to an AOI:

  $ planet orders get 49b8d32e-2fba-4924-bd38-f7344aa48d91 > \
planet orders request --clip aoi.geojson

  Note that if the order description contains a tool chain with more tools
  than just clip, using --clip will override the entire tool chain, not just
  the clip tool.

Options:  
  --name TEXT                     Order name. Does not need to be unique.
                                  [required]  
  --bundle [analytic|analytic_udm2|analytic_3b_udm2|analytic_5b|analytic_5b_udm2|analytic_8b_udm2|visual|uncalibrated_dn|uncalibrated_dn_udm2|basic_analytic|basic_analytic_udm2|basic_analytic_8b_udm2|basic_uncalibrated_dn|basic_uncalibrated_dn_udm2|analytic_sr|analytic_sr_udm2|analytic_8b_sr_udm2|basic_uncalibrated_dn_nitf|basic_uncalibrated_dn_nitf_udm2|basic_analytic_nitf|basic_analytic_nitf_udm2|basic_panchromatic|basic_panchromatic_dn|panchromatic|panchromatic_dn|panchromatic_dn_udm2|pansharpened|pansharpened_udm2|basic_l1a_dn]  
                                  Product bundle.  [required]  
  --id TEXT                       One or more comma-separated item IDs.
                                  [required]  
  --item-type TEXT                Specify an item type  [required]  
  --clip JSON                     Clip feature GeoJSON. Can be a json string,
                                  filename, or '-' for stdin.  
  --tools JSON                    Toolchain JSON. Can be a json string,
                                  filename, or '-' for stdin.  
  --email                         Send email notification when order is
                                  complete.  
  --cloudconfig JSON              Credentials for cloud storage provider to
                                  enable cloud delivery of data. Can be a json
                                  string, filename, or '-' for stdin.  
  --pretty                        Format JSON output.
