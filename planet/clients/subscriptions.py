class SubscriptionsClient:
    """A Planet Subscriptions Service API 1.0.0 client.

    The methods of this class forward request parameters to the
    operations described in the Planet Subscriptions Service API 1.0.0
    (https://api.planet.com/subscriptions/v1/spec) using HTTP 1.1.

    The methods generally return or yield Python dicts with the same
    structure as the JSON messages used by the service API. Many of the
    exceptions raised by this class are categorized by HTTP client
    (4xx) or server (5xx) errors. This client's level of abstraction is
    low.

    High-level asynchronous access to Planet's subscriptions API:

    Example:
        ```python
        >>> import asyncio
        >>> from planet import Session
        >>>
        >>> async def main():
        ...     async with Session() as sess:
        ...         cl = sess.client('subscriptions')
        ...         # use client here

            This method provides iteration over subscriptions, it does
            not return a list.

        Args:
            created (str): filter by created time or interval.
            end_time (str): filter by end time or interval.
            hosting (bool): only return subscriptions that contain a
                hosting block (e.g. SentinelHub hosting).
            name__contains (str): only return subscriptions with a
                name that contains the given string.
            name (str): filter by name.
            source_type (str): filter by source type.
            start_time (str): filter by start time or interval.
            status (Set[str]): include subscriptions with a status in this set.
            sort_by (str): fields to sort subscriptions by. Multiple
                fields can be specified, separated by commas. The sort
                direction can be specified by appending ' ASC' or '
                DESC' to the field name. The default sort direction is
                ascending. When multiple fields are specified, the sort
                order is applied in the order the fields are listed.

                Supported fields: name, created, updated, start_time, end_time

                Examples:
                 * "name"

                 * "name,end_time DESC,start_time"
            updated (str): filter by updated time or interval.
            limit (int): limit the number of subscriptions in the
                results. When set to 0, no maximum is applied.
            TODO: user_id

        Datetime args (created, end_time, start_time, updated) can either be a
        date-time or an interval, open or closed. Date and time expressions adhere
        to RFC 3339. Open intervals are expressed using double-dots.

        Examples:
            * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
            * A closed interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
