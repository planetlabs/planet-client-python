# Planet SDK for Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/planetlabs/planet-client-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/planetlabs/planet-client-python)

[Planet](https://planet.com) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python.

## Versions and Stability

The default branch (main) of this repo is for the [Planet SDK for 
Python](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/projects/2),
a complete rewrite and upgrade from the original [Planet Python 
Client](https://developers.planet.com/docs/pythonclient/). If you 
are looking for the source code to that library see the 
[v1](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/tree/v1) branch.

The Planet SDK for Python is in 'pre-release' stages, working towards an 
initial release around July. Active development is tracked in the [Planet SDK 
for Python Project](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/projects/2). 
The initial release will support Orders, Data and Subscription API's in the 
command-line interface, with corresponding Python libraries. We expect 'beta' 
milestones to be released in some form for each of the API's. After the 
initial July release there will be additional work to support the remaining 
Planet API's ([analytics](https://developers.planet.com/docs/analytics/), 
[basemaps](https://developers.planet.com/docs/basemaps/) and 
[tasking](https://developers.planet.com/docs/tasking/)).

## Documentation

Full documentation is not yet hosted online but can be built and hosted locally
(see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)) or can be read from source in the
`[docs](docs/)` directory.

## Quick Start

The Planet SDK for Python allows Python developers to write software that makes
use of the following Planet APIs:

* [orders](https://developers.planet.com/docs/orders/)
* [data](https://developers.planet.com/docs/data/) (not yet implemented)
* [subscriptions](https://developers.planet.com/docs/subscriptions/) (not 
 yet implemented)

The client modules within the Python library are asynchronous, which greatly
speeds up many interactions with Planet's APIs. Support for asynchronous
development is native to Python 3.6+ via the
[`asyncio` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). A great
resource for getting started with asynchronous programming in Python is
https://project-awesome.org/timofurrer/awesome-asyncio. The Writings and Talks
sections are particularly helpful in getting oriented.

Let's start with creating an order with the Orders API:

```python
>>> import asyncio
>>> import os
>>> import planet
>>>
>>> request = {
...   "name": "test_order",
...   "products": [
...     {
...       "item_ids": [
...         "3949357_1454705_2020-12-01_241c"
...       ],
...       "item_type": "PSOrthoTile",
...       "product_bundle": "analytic"
...     }
...   ]
... }
...
>>> async def create_order(request):
...     async with planet.Session() as ps:
...         client = planet.OrdersClient(ps)
...         return await client.create_order(request)
...
>>> oid = asyncio.run(create_order(request))

```

Not into async? No problem. Just wrap the library and async operations together
and call from your synchronous code.

```python
>>> def sync_create_order(order_details):
...     return asyncio.run(create_order(order_details))
>>>
>>> oid = sync_create_order(order_details)

```

When using `asyncio.run` to develop synchronous code with the async library,
keep in mind this excerpt from the
[asyncio.run](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.run)
documentation:

"*This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It
should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally
only be called once.*"

Do you have a use case where native synchronous support is essential? If so,
please contribute to this
[discussion](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/issues/251).

Why async? Because things get *really cool* when you want to work with multiple
orders. See [orders_create_and_download_multiple_orders.py](examples/orders_create_and_download_multiple_orders.py) for
an example of submitting two orders, waiting for them to complete, and
downloading them. The orders each clip a set of images to a specific area of
interest (AOI), so they cannot be combined into one order.
(hint: [Planet Explorer](https://www.planet.com/explorer/) was used to define
the AOIs and get the image ids.)

## Installation

Install with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):

```console
$ python -m pip install . 
```

The [--user](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs)
flag is highly recommended for those new to pip.

The Planet SDK for Python requires Python 3.7+.
