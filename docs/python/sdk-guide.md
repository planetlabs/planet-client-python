title: Python SDK User Guide
---

This guide is for Planet SDK for Python users who want to use Python code to search, order, customize, and deliver Planet imagery and data. If you’re new to Python, you may want to choose the no-code option of using the [command-line interface (CLI)](../../cli/cli-guide). But if you’ve successfully followed the instructions to [get started](../../get-started/quick-start-guide) and you’re ready to try your hand at Python coding, this guide should be all you need to use this SDK to get Planet data.

This guide walks you through the steps:

* **[Create a session](#create-a-session)**—set up a context for calling on Planet servers and receiving data back.
* **[Authenticate](#authenticate-with-planet-services)**—pass your API key to Planet services to verify your permissions to data.
* **[Create an order](#create-an-order)**build an orders client, send the request within the session context, and download it when it’s ready.
* **[Collect and list data](#collecting-results)**—handle the potentially large number of results from a search for imagery.
* **[Query the data catalog](#query-the-data-catalog)**—search the catalog based on a filter, activate the assets you want, and download and validate it when it’s ready.

## Create a session

Communication with the Planet services is provided with the `Session` class.
The recommended way to use a `Session` is as a context manager. This will
provide for automatic clean up of connections when the context is left.

```python
import asyncio
import os
from planet import Session

async def main():
    async with Session() as sess:
        # perform operations here
        pass

asyncio.run(main())

```

Alternatively, use `await Session.aclose()` to close a `Session` explicitly:

```python
async def main():
    sess = Session()
    # perform operations here
    await sess.aclose()

asyncio.run(main())

```

## Authenticate with Planet services

There are two steps to managing authentication information, obtaining the
authentication information from Planet and then managing it for local retrieval
for authentication purposes.

The recommended method for obtaining authentication information is through
logging in, using `Auth.from_login()` (note: using something like the `getpass`
module is recommended to ensure your password remains secure). Alternatively,
the api key can be obtained directly from the Planet account site and then used
in `Auth.from_key()`.

Once the authentication information is obtained, the most convenient way of
managing it for local use is to write it to a secret file using `Auth.write()`.
It can also be accessed, e.g. to store in an environment variable, as
`Auth.value`.

For example, to obtain and store authentication information:

```python
import getpass
from planet import Auth

pw = getpass.getpass()
auth = Auth.from_login('user', 'pw')
auth.write()

```

When a `Session` is created, by default, authentication is read from the secret
file created with `Auth.write()`. This behavior can be modified by specifying
`Auth` explicitly using the methods `Auth.from_file()` and `Auth.from_env()`.
While `Auth.from_key()` and `Auth.from_login` can be used, it is recommended
that those functions be used in authentication initialization and the
authentication information be stored using `Auth.write()`.

The file and environment variable read from can be customized in the
respective functions. For example, authentication can be read from a custom
environment variable:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from planet import Auth, Session

auth = Auth.from_env('ALTERNATE_VAR')
async def main():
    async with Session(auth=auth) as sess:
        # perform operations here
        pass

asyncio.run(main())

```

## Create an order

The Orders Client mostly mirrors the
[Orders API](https://developers.planet.com/docs/orders/reference/#tag/Orders),
with the only difference being the addition of the ability to poll for when an
order is completed and to download an entire order.

```python
from planet import OrdersClient

async def main():
    async with Session() as sess:
        client = OrdersClient(sess)
        # perform operations here

asyncio.run(main())

```

### Your orders client

When creating an order, the order request details must be provided to the API
as a JSON blob. This JSON blob can be built up manually or by using the
`build_request` function.

An example of creating the request JSON with `build_request`:

```python
from planet import order_request
products = [
    order_request.product(['20170614_113217_3163208_RapidEye-5'],
                          'analytic', 'REOrthoTile')
]

tools = [
    order_request.toar_tool(scale_factor=10000),
    order_request.reproject_tool(projection='WSG84', kernel='cubic'),
    order_request.tile_tool(1232, origin_x=-180, origin_y=-90,
              pixel_size=0.000027056277056,
              name_template='C1232_30_30_{tilex:04d}_{tiley:04d}')
]

request = order_request.build_request(
    'test_order', products=products, tools=tools)


```

The same thing, expressed as a `JSON` blob:

```python
request = {
  "name": "test_order",
  "products": [
    {
      "item_ids": [
        "20170614_113217_3163208_RapidEye-5"
      ],
      "item_type": "REOrthoTile",
      "product_bundle": "analytic"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "toar": {
        "scale_factor": 10000
      }
    },
    {
      "reproject": {
        "projection": "WSG84",
        "kernel": "cubic"
      }
    },
    {
      "tile": {
        "tile_size": 1232,
        "origin_x": -180,
        "origin_y": -90,
        "pixel_size": 2.7056277056e-05,
        "name_template": "C1232_30_30_{tilex:04d}_{tiley:04d}"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

Once the order request is built up, creating an order is done within
the context of a `Session` with the `OrdersClient`:

```python
async def main():
    async with Session() as sess:
        cl = OrdersClient(sess)
        order = await cl.create_order(request)

asyncio.run(main())

```

### Waiting and downloading an order

Once an order is created, the Orders API takes some time to create the order
and thus we must wait a while before downloading the order.
We can use waiting to watch the order creation process and find out when the
order is created successfully and ready to download.

With wait and download, it is often desired to track progress as these
processes can take a long time. Therefore, in this example, we use a progress
bar from the `reporting` module to report wait status. `download_order` has
reporting built in.

```python
from planet import reporting

async def create_wait_and_download():
    async with Session() as sess:
        cl = OrdersClient(sess)
        with reporting.StateBar(state='creating') as bar:
            # create order
            order = await cl.create_order(request)
            bar.update(state='created', order_id=order['id'])

            # poll
            await cl.wait(order['id'], callback=bar.update_state)

        # download
        await cl.download_order(order['id'])

asyncio.run(create_poll_and_download())
```

### Validating checksums

Checksum validation provides for verification that the files in an order have
been downloaded successfully and are not missing, corrupted, or changed. This
functionality is included in the OrderClient, but does not require an instance
of the class to be used.


To perform checksum validation:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# path includes order id
order_path = Path('193e5bd1-dedc-4c65-a539-6bc70e55d928')
OrdersClient.validate_checksum(order_path, 'md5')
```

## Collecting results

Some API calls, such as searching for imagery and listing orders, return a
varying, and potentially large, number of results. These API responses are
paged. The SDK manages paging internally and the associated client commands
return an asynchronous iterator over the results. These results can be
converted to a JSON blob using the `collect` command. When the results
represent GeoJSON features, the JSON blob is a GeoJSON FeatureCollection.
Otherwise, the JSON blob is a list of the individual results.


```python
import asyncio
from planet import collect, OrdersClient, Session

async def main():
    async with Session() as sess:
        client = OrdersClient(sess)
        orders_aiter = client.list_orders_aiter()
        orders_list = collect(orders_aiter)

asyncio.run(main())

```

Alternatively, these results can be converted to a list directly with

```python
        orders_list = [o async for o in client.list_orders_aiter()]
```

## Query the data catalog

The Data Client mostly mirrors the
[Data API](https://developers.planet.com/docs/apis/data/reference/),
with the only difference being the addition of functionality to activate an
asset, poll for when activation is complete, and download the asset.

```python
from planet import DataClient

async def main():
    async with Session() as sess:
        client = DataClient(sess)
        # perform operations here

asyncio.run(main())

```

### Filter

When performing a quick search, creating or updating a saved search, or
requesting stats, the data search filter must be provided to the API
as a JSON blob. This JSON blob can be built up manually or by using the
`data_filter` module.

An example of creating the request JSON with `data_filter`:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from planet import data_filter
sfilter = data_filter.and_filter([
    data_filter.permission_filter(),
    data_filter.date_range_filter('acquired', gt=datetime(2022, 6, 1, 1))
])
```

The same thing, expressed as a `JSON` blob:

```python
sfilter = {
    'type': 'AndFilter',
    'config': [
        {'type': 'PermissionFilter', 'config': ['assets:download']},
        {
            'type': 'DateRangeFilter',
            'field_name': 'acquired',
            'config': {'gt': '2022-06-01T01:00:00Z'}
        }
    ]
}
```

Once the filter is built up, performing a search is done within
the context of a `Session` with the `DataClient`:

```python
async def main():
    async with Session() as sess:
        cl = DataClient(sess)
        items = await cl.search(['PSScene'], sfilter)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Downloading an asset

Downloading an asset is a multi-step process involving: activating the asset,
waiting for the asset to be active, downloading the asset, and, optionally,
validating the downloaded file.


With wait and download, it is often desired to track progress as these
processes can take a long time. Therefore, in this example, we use a simple 
print command to report wait status. `download_asset` has reporting built in.

```python
async def download_and_validate():
    async with Session() as sess:
        cl = DataClient(sess)

        # get asset description
        item_type_id = 'PSScene'
        item_id = '20221003_002705_38_2461'
        asset_type_id = 'ortho_analytic_4b'
        asset = await cl.get_asset(item_type_id, item_id, asset_type_id)
        
        # activate asset
        await cl.activate_asset(asset)

        # wait for asset to become active
        asset = await cl.wait_asset(asset, callback=print)

        # download asset
        path = await cl.download_asset(asset)

        # validate download file
        cl.validate_checksum(asset, path)
```
