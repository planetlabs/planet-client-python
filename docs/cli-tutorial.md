## Commands

### Auth

Initialize with user name and password

```console
$ planet auth init
```

See API key that is being used for requests

```console
$ planet auth value
```

*NOTE: Right now you must init before you get help, until https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/issues/463 is resolved*

### Get Help

Most commands are pretty self-documenting, can use `--help` after any command to get usage info. And many will give you help
if you don't form a complete command.

```console
$ planet --help
$ planet
$ planet orders
$ planet orders list --help
```

### Orders

See recent orders you've made

```console
$ planet orders list
```

Print them more nicely
(both are options, jq is a bit more advanced, but prints a bit nicer and is more powerful)

```console
$ planet orders list | jq
$ planet orders list --pretty
```

Get the number of your recent orders. (-s collects objects into a single array)

```console
$ planet orders list | jq -s length
```

Get more info on a single order

```console
$ planet orders get 782b414e-4e34-4f31-86f4-5b757bd062d7
```

Download the order

```console
$ planet orders download 782b414e-4e34-4f31-86f4-5b757bd062d7
```

Download it to a different directory (relative to where the command is run)


```console
$ mkdir psscene
$ planet orders download 782b414e-4e34-4f31-86f4-5b757bd062d7 --directory psscene
```

Download to a directory specified absolutely (in this case to my desktop)

```console
$ planet orders download 782b414e-4e34-4f31-86f4-5b757bd062d7 --directory /Users/cholmes/Desktop/
```

Verify the checksum to make sure the file I got wasn't corrupted along the way (during download, etc)

```console
$ planet orders download 782b414e-4e34-4f31-86f4-5b757bd062d7 --checksum MD5
```

Create a new order request from a scene ID found in Explorer
(Note that \ just tells the console to treat the next line as the same one - used here to be a bit easier to read)

```console
$ planet orders request --name "My First Order" --bundle analytic_sr_udm2 --id 20220605_124027_64_242b \
 --item-type PSScene
```

Save to a file in the directory where the command was run

```console
$ planet orders request --name "My First Order" --bundle analytic_sr_udm2 --id 20220605_124027_64_242b \
 --item-type PSScene > request-1.json
```

Make a new order with that request (should be the same as 
[this one](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cholmes/892f851d5c55f7cf93e210595750ecfe/raw/4c255dcdf0973e0f72d43d82c776d8251fb7545e/request-1.json))

```console
$ planet orders create request-1.json
```

Create the request and make a new order with it all in one call

```console
$ planet orders request --name "My First Order" --bundle analytic_sr_udm2 --id 20220605_124027_64_242b \
 --item-type PSScene | planet orders create
```

Download the order. Note this only works when the order is ready:

```console
$ planet orders download 65df4eb0-e416-4243-a4d2-38afcf382c30
```

Wait until the order is ready for download, then order it:

```console
$ planet orders wait 65df4eb0-e416-4243-a4d2-38afcf382c30 \
&& planet orders download 65df4eb0-e416-4243-a4d2-38afcf382c30 
```

Create an order from a request, wait for it and download when ready 
(TODO: this works, but doesn't match usage examples, so should align to that.)

```console
$ id=`planet orders create request-1.json | jq -r '.id'` && planet orders wait $id && planet orders download $id
```

Create an order clipped to a geometry

(download [raw json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cholmes/c7736ac5241d77605524d01ed2dc57a1/raw/7d24e02ba894e64c4c737c253a0cce4cac54167c/geometry.geojson) 
from github, or [preview](https://gist.github.com/cholmes/c7736ac5241d77605524d01ed2dc57a1))

```console
$ planet orders request --item-type PSScene --clip geometry.geojson --name clipped-geom \
 --bundle analytic_sr_udm2 --id 20220605_124027_64_242b | planet orders create
```

Order Two Scenes in one order

```console
$ planet orders request --item-type PSScene --name "Two Scenes" \
 --bundle analytic_sr_udm2 --id 20220605_124027_64_242b,20220605_124025_34_242b | planet orders create
```

Composite them together

Use this, save as tools-composite.json

```json
[
    {
      "composite": {
        }
    }
]
```

Then create command and order

```console
$ planet orders request --item-type PSScene --name "Two Scenes Composited" \
 --bundle analytic_sr_udm2 --id 20220605_124027_64_242b,20220605_124025_34_242b --tools tools-composite.json | planet orders create
```

Get the output as a cloud-optimized GeoTIFF:
(save as tools-cog.json)

```json
[
    {
      "composite": {
        }
    },
    {
    "file_format": {
        "format": "COG"
      }
    }
]
```

The following command just shows the output, you can pipe into orders create if you'd like:

```console
$ planet orders request --item-type PSScene --name "Two Scenes Composited" \
 --bundle analytic_sr_udm2 --id 20220605_124027_64_242b,20220605_124025_34_242b --tools tools-cog.json
```

To clip and composite you need to specify the clip in the tools (instead of `--clip`).
Can get it from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/cholmes/378d050a263ae433ddbbb91c3439994b)

```console
$ planet orders request --item-type PSScene --name "Two Scenes Clipped and Composited" \
 --bundle analytic_sr_udm2 --id 20220605_124027_64_242b,20220605_124025_34_242b --tools tools-clip-composite.json
```

Or can even stream that in:

```console
$ url -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cholmes/378d050a263ae433ddbbb91c3439994b/raw/ebcaa54cacdc6f696a0506705785f8ff8dae9af1/ \
tools-clip-composite.json | planet orders request --item-type PSScene --name "Streaming Clip & Composite" \
 --bundle analytic_sr_udm2 --id 20220605_124027_64_242b,20220605_124025_34_242b --tools - | planet orders create
```

### Data

Run a search for all the latest planetscope scenes that you have download access to:

```console
$ planet data filter > filter.json
$ planet data search-quick PSScene filter.json
```

Or using piping (recommended)

```console
$ planet data filter | planet data search-quick PSScene -
```

Run a search for all the latest PS Scenes in a bounding box in Iowa:

Save this as geometry.json

```json

      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {},
      "geometry": {

            [
              -93.7353,
              41.6236
            ],
            [
              -92.2741,

              -92.2741,
              42.3747
            ],
            [
              -93.7353,
              42.3747
            ],
            [
              -93.7353,
              41.6236
            ]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```console
$ planet data filter --geom geometry.json | planet data search-quick PSScene -
```

And turn into GeoJSON

```console
$ planet data filter --geom geometry.json | planet data search-quick PSScene - | planet collect
```

$ 
```
