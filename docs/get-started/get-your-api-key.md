# Get Your API Key

Whenever you use this toolkit to connect to Planet Labs PBC, you'll need to authenticate with the Planet server. To do so, you need to provide an API key. 

You can find your API key in your [Account](https://account.planet.com/) under My Settings. You can also retrieve it when viewing scenes in Planet Explorer by selecting "API {:}" at the bottom of the daily scene panel.

If you don't have an API key, you can [sign up here](https://www.planet.com/explorer/?signup).
