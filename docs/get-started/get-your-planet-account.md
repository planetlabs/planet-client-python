title: Get Your Planet Account
---

When you use the Planet SDK for Python to connect to Planet APIs, you must first authenticate. To do this, you need a Planet account with your username and password.

## Getting your Planet Account Credentials

### Sign In to Planet Explorer

If you go to <a href="https://www.planet.com/explorer/#" target="_blank" >Planet Explorer</a>, you will be prompted to enter your account username and password. That is the same username and password that you will use to authenticate with the Planet SDK for Python.

### Finding Your API Key

You may also use an API key to authenticate with the Planet SDK for Python. Once in Explorer, you can select the user icon in the upper-right corner to access your account page. From there, select **My Settings** to find your API key.

     margin-right: auto;
     width:50%;

### Sign Up for a Trial Account

If you don’t have an account, but you want to take our APIs for a spin, you can sign up for the <a href="https://insights.planet.com/sign-up/" target="_blank">30-day platform trial</a>. Note that the trial does not include access to all Planet APIs. You will not be able to use the full functionality of the SDK and you will not be able to order imagery. You are able to use the trial to search with the Data API.

## Authenticating with the Planet server

After you’ve installed the Planet SDK, you can authenticate with the Planet server as outlined in the [No-Code CLI Guide](../../cli/cli-guide/#authentication)

## Next Steps

Now that you have confirmed your Planet account username and password, you can proceed with the other steps in the [Quick Start Guide](../quick-start-guide).
