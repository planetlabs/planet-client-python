Get a Planet Account

Whenever you use this toolkit to connect to Planet Labs PBC, you'll need to authenticate with the Planet server. To do so, you need a Planet account. 

## Confirm your Planet Account

If you go to Planet Explorer, and you have an account, you'll be prompted to enter your account username and password. Once in Explorer, you can select the user icon in the upper right corner to go to your Account page:

my-account-in-planet-explorer

You can find your API key in your [Account](https://account.planet.com/) under My Settings. You can also retrieve it when viewing scenes in Planet Explorer by selecting "API {:}" at the bottom of the daily scene panel.

If you don't have an API key, you can [sign up here](https://www.planet.com/explorer/?signup).
