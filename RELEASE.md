# Version Release

*Planet maintainers only*

Releasing is a two-step process: (1) releasing on Github and test.pypi and (2) releasing to pypi. Releasing on Github will automatically trigger a release on test.pypi via a Github Action. Following manual confirmation of a successful and satisfactory release on test.pypi, release on pypi is triggered manually with the Github Action "Automatically Publish on TestPyPi". There is also an option to publish to test.pypi and pypi from your local machine.

#### Release Naming Conventions

The following are the release naming conventions:

1. Current Dev Version is obtained from `planet/__version__.py`
1. Release Version: Remove `dev` from Current Dev Version
1. Next Dev Version: Bumped version of last release with `dev` added to the end.
    * **PROPOSAL**: Version number is determined by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)


##### Example:

**IF** Current Dev Version ==  `1.0.0dev` **THEN**
  * Release Version: `1.0.0`
  * Next Dev Version: `1.0.1dev`

## Release Workflow

The release on Github and PyPi performed from a release branch while the release branch PR is in progress. After the releases, the version in the PR is updated before it is merged. Thus, the version in `main` is not the same as the version of the release.

*NOTE: This section refers to version names given in Release Naming Conventions section above.*

1. Create a release branch named `release-{Release Version}`
1. Make the following changes for the release
  * Update `CHANGES.txt` (**PROPOSAL**: change this to `docs/CHANGELOG.md`)
    * Include added, changed, depricated or removed features and bug fixes.
       A list of merged PRs and their titles since the last release can be obtained with `git log <RELEASE_TAG>..HEAD | awk '/Merge pull request/{print;getline;getline;print}`
    * Sort according to importance
    * **PROPOSAL**: Adhere to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
  * Update `planet/__version__.py` to Release Version
1. Create a PR for the release branch (named after release branch, description is changelog entry), wait for CI to pass
1. Create a new github release:
  * Set Tag Release Version
  * **!!!** Set Target to the release branch **!!!**
  * Copy Description from the new entry in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
  * Select "This is a pre-release" if applicable
  * Select "Create a discussion for this release"
1. Verify the successful run of the Github Action "Autopublish to TestPyPi" and validate the test release on [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/project/planet/)
1. Run the Github Action "Publish on PyPi", **!!!** Set Branch to the release branch **!!!**
1. Verify the successful run of the Github Action "Publish on PyPi" and validate the release on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/planet/)
1. Push a commit to the PR updating `planet/__version__.py` to Next Dev Version
1. Merge PR
1. Announce the release through the following avenues:
 * *Planet Internal:* #python slack channel
 * Changelog
 * Twitter

### Local publishing

Publishing to testpypi and pypi can also be performed locally with:

```console
  $ nox -s build publish-testpypi
```
then
```console
  $ nox -s publish-pypi
```
this approach requires specifying the pypi/testpypi api token as the password at the prompt.
