2.13.0 (2024-12-18)
- Add Planet class (`from planet import Planet`)
  - Planet is a client that uses sync methods. Users do not have 
    to interact with asyncio to use the sync client.
  - the Planet class is implemented by calling out to the async methods.
    This should be transparent to users. Depending on uptake and feedback,
    the underlying implementation may change in the future (but we will commit
    to semantic versioning when it comes to breaking changes in the API).

2.12.0 (2024-12-09)
- Add parameters to the subscriptions list command: --source-type, --created, --start-time,
  --end-time, --updated, --hosting, --name, --name-contains, and --sort-by.
- Add parameters to the orders list command: --source-type, --name,
  --name-contains, --created-on, --last-modified, --hosting, and --sort-by.
- Remove the unused limit parameter of SubscriptionsClient.get_results_csv

  typing.Literal. It is now imported exclusively from typing_extensions and
  Python 3.7, while EOL, will be supported for a while longer (#).
- The upper version pin for click has been removed. This project ignores type
  errors involving click.command() and click.group() since 2.1.0 and does not
  need to avoid click 8.1.4 or 8.1.5.

Added:

  of the next version of the Subscriptions API (#971).


2.0.3 (2023-06-28)

Changed:
- Orders CLI now forces STAC to false for GEE deliveries. This is due to the
  Orders API change to surface validation errors when stac is specified for GEE
